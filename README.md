TigerHacks 2021 

This project was created to track satellites using the user's IP Address, then display the satellites to a map, which will
show them moving across that map. You can also make the map bigger/smaller, and choose what satellites you want to display.

TO TRY THE PROJECT OUT YOURSELF:
Make sure you are running the latest versions of JDK and JRE!

Download the .jar file from the repository and open it. The project will then open automatically!
